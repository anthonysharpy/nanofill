speed benchmarks/tests?
messages/second benchmark/test?

check intent for issues. e.g. what happens if it tries to buy below 0 price? this will happen probably with current code lol.
maybe fix that

if my engine buys at the average it might never actually buy anything. since the price is unlikely to suddenly jump
to the average, and we don't buy near the average. lol

configurable price bands as part of risk check
japanese translations?

try the pause command in creator thread


low latency -> IS NOT HIGH-THROUGHPUT

jitter is unacceptable
avoid branches
multithreading is not necessarily good
use inline attributes - but be sure to measure before/after
always run the hot path. dump a bad order at the last moment. keeps the cache warm and improves branch prediction
the producer could filter out crap?
mark cold paths as unlikely
