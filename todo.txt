check intent for issues. e.g. what happens if it tries to buy below 0 price? this will happen probably with current code lol.
maybe fix that

if my engine buys at the average it might never actually buy anything. since the price is unlikely to suddenly jump
to the average, and we don't buy near the average. lol

configurable price bands as part of risk check
japanese translations?

try the pause command in creator thread

avoid branches
the producer could filter out crap?
mark cold paths as unlikely

we can probably shrink event size to int16? tbh

remove order - instead of popping, set a rubbished flag?

clean shouldn't clean tests cus its annoying
